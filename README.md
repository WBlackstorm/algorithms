# Algorithms
This project is a set of different algorithms that I have used to solve some problems.
Idea in this case is add more and more ones to help people to solve their own problems.
These are available codes:
- Biggest Palindrome
- Largest Prime Factor
- Rangoli
- BFS
- Dijkstra
- Bellman-Ford
- LCM - Latest Common Multiple
- GCD - Greatest Common Divisor
